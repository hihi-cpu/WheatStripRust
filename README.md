This dataset was collected by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) during the 2019â€“2020 rabi season using a Sony IMX363 RGB camera, capturing wheat leaf images at the booting stage. It includes two types of stress: nitrogen deficiency (abiotic stress) and leaf rust (biotic stress), along with corresponding healthy leaf images. The images were segmented from the background using the Otsu thresholding method and are organized into training, validation, and test sets with a 70:15:15 split. A total of 1,159 images are provided, making the dataset suitable for deep learning-based crop stress detection research.

This dataset, the recently collected WSRgrading dataset from Northwest A\&F University, was used to validate the performance of C-DenseNet and its variants. It includes wheat leaf images covering six levels of stripe rust infection, captured under natural field conditions using various mobile devices.

The location of the data collection is at Holeta wheat farm, Ethiopia, and it was captured in a real wheat farm in an uncontrolled environment. Besides, it was sorted into three classes with the assistance of plant pathologists: the classes are Stripe Rust, Septoria, and Healthy. The camera used is  Canon EOS 5D Mark III, it is a high-resolution digital camera capable of showing the detail of the leaf.  Finally, the dataset could help researchers in the field of computer vision for plant disease detection research.

A team of researchers from Turkey in collaboration with experts have created a database of yellow rust in wheat with different severity levels. The Data Set consists of raw and pre-processed (YELLOW-RUST-19) images with categories of healthy and yellow rust diseased leaf images. It is foreseen that the data set will guide related studies in the area. The sowed area belongs to the Republic of Turkey Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Directorate of Field Crops Central Research Institute and is reserved for fungus disease experiments on cereals, especially yellow rust in wheat. The area is located near Haymana-Ankara in Turkey. The sowing was completed between October and November 2018.
